The IOOS CodeLab is a collection of tutorials and examples of how to access and utilize the many IOOS technologies and data sources available.
This site is geared towards scientists and environmental managers interested in “diving deep” into the numbers and creating original plots and data analysis.
Most notebook examples are written in Python, however,
we also have a growing number of notebooks written in Matlab, and R.

The notebooks will come from a variety of authors including IOOS Program Office Staff,
Regional Association data managers,
and other IOOS partners.
If you think you have a nice example you would like to share please see the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/ioos/ioos_code_lab/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
