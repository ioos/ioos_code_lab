# Data Access

IOOS data comes from a variety of technologies or data collection systems. While types of data available through any
one of our 11 regional associations may vary depending on the local area, the national IOOS data products include data
collected from buoys, high frequency radar systems and gliders. Modeling teams across regional associations also create
data products including physical and environmental models of coastal systems.

IOOS data can be accessed through a variety of access services and tools through IOOS interactive maps, Data Assembly
Centers (DACs), and individual Regional Association portals. This chapter provides examples of the various data access
services (SOS, THREDDS, ERDDAP, etc) and tools for scientists and managers looking to access data using various programing languages (Python,
Matlab, R, etc).
